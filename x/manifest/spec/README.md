# `manifest`

## Abstract

This document specifies the internal `x/manifest` module of The Lifted Initiative, Manifest Ledger.

The `x/manifest` module provides the following abilities:
- Manual minting of tokens
- Manual burning of tokens

The network inflation is not tied to a standard bonded ratio like typical proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, Instead it is up to chain admin(s) to decide given the nature of a proof-of-authority (PoA) chain.
